# vsx-theme-reify

My color theme for VSCodium/VS Code.

It's currently not published anywhere, since I'm still experimenting with it. If you'd like to use it, you can clone this repo and do the following:

For VSCodium:

```shell
npm install
npm run package
codium --install-extension ./vsx-theme-reify-0.0.1.vsix
```

For VS Code:

```shell
npm install
npm run package
code --install-extension ./vsx-theme-reify-0.0.1.vsix
```

Or, after `npm run package`, you can open the command palette, find "Extensions: Install from VSIX...", and install the `.vsix` file that way.
